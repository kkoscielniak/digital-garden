# `$ whoami`

My name is Krystian Kościelniak. I’m a proud husband and father to a sneaky toddler.

I [write code](https://github.com/kkoscielniak) for a living. Whenever I am not doing that or looking after my kiddo’, I [[reading/index|read]], [[experiments/index|experiment]], play video games or try to make sample-based boombap beats.

## What's this place?

This is my [[about/digital-garden|digital garden]] - a place for sharing what I learn in public. It's messy by design.

You may roam around freely or use `⌘+K` for a site-wide search.

::: warning
I'm working on a new version of this site. As of now there are still issues to resolve and content to migrate. The old content is available [here](https://github.com/kkoscielniak/the-garden-content).

## Wanna talk?

Don't think twice. Drop me <a href="mailto:krystian@koscielniak.pro">an email</a>, or DM me on [Insta](https://instagram.com/pankoscielniak) instead. I don’t check [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krystian-koÅ9Bcielniak-629102a7/) a lot, but you may try as well.
