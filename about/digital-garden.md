## Digital what?

This site is a [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden/) of mine. Basically it's a bunch of short notes stitched together into something bigger.

The main goals of this project are:

- having a living documentation on what I've learnt and what I am interested in
  - this might be interesting for recruiters üòâ
- share that knowledge with others
  - people quite often ask me about _things_, this garden allows me to immediately point them to my notes
- linking my thinking
  - tools like [[tools/apps/obsidian|Obsidian]] allow me to quickly find links between notes that gradually combine into new ways of thinking, ultimately helping me to thrive in my field of expertise
- improving my _writing game_
  - even though these notes are rather short, they still need to be readable

All of that without having to write catchy blog posts, dealing with comments, SEO and all of that crap.

::: warning
I keep this garden **mostly for myself**. I guess I enjoy writing ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
On the other hand, **sharing is caring**. It's quite possible you'll get some value from whatever you find here.

## Messy by design

Similarly to [[knowledge/adhd|myself]], this digital garden is messy by design. This means the ideas, snippets, resources or thoughts presented here might not (and most of the time - won't) be well-written, perfectly organised, up-to-date or even true üò±

It's all about evolution. I evolve, my thinking evolves, and so do the JavaScript frameworks.

It's hard to keep up on everything and people make mistakes. But each time my knowledge expands, so does this garden.

The good part is that the whole thing is [open source](https://github.com/kkoscielniak/digital-garden), so if you stumble upon something evidently wrong, you can always open a PR.

## Technical nitpicks

This site is written in [[tools/apps/obsidian|Obsidian]] and built using [[tools/apps/vite-press|VitePress]]. I keep the Obsidian Vault on [GitHub](https://github.com/kkoscielniak/digital-garden) and host it with [GitHub Pages](https://pages/github.com).
