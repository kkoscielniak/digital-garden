## _Digital_ what?

This site is a [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden/), not a blog. I keep it mostly for myself, but I suppose it might be helpful to others as well.

The goal of this project is to be a living reference of what I've learnt, what I am interested in and what skills I actually have.

The main value is not in the carefully crafted blog posts full of anectodes, graphs, opinions and else. Instead, it lies in _linking my thinking_. Recently I learn a lot and I want to find patterns that will help me to improve in my field of expertise.

## Non-linearity

Due to a _non-linear_ nature of this site, I might post here ideas, snippets, resources, thoughts, bits of knowledge, projects of mine or basically anything I find interesting and relating to the rest of the content here. It's basically my own, basic Wikipedia.

This also means not everything is going to be well-writen, perfectly organised, or even truthy. Things change, I change, JavaScript frameworks change. It's hard to keep up sometimes and people make mistakes.

The good part is that the whole thing is [open-source](https://github.com/kkoscielniak/digital-garden), so if you stumble upon something evidently wrong, you can always open a PR or an issue.

## Technical nitpicks

This site is written in [[tools/apps/obsidian|Obsidian]] and built using [[tools/apps/vite-press|VitePress]]. I keep the Obsidian Vault on [GitHub](https://github.com/kkoscielniak/digital-garden) and host it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages/github.com).
