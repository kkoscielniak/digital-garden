title: "One Small Step Can Change Your Life: The Kaizen Way"
---

by Robert Maurer | ⭐⭐⭐

A way tool long introduction to the method of small steps.

## Innovation

The word _innovation_ is commonly used to mean a _breakthrough achievement_. In business, it means a _drastic change_
(which ideally lasts a short time, causing huge changes at once; a shocking, radical change), for example:

- mass layoffs (lasts a short time), sudden need for restructuring
- investing money in a startup (lasts a short time), huge profit
  (but also outside of business)
- quitting an addiction _cold-turkey_
- a radical plan to get rid of debt

Radical changes can cause burnout.

## _Kaizen_

In business: The opposite of [Innovation](#Innovation). Literally: the method of continuous
improvement of management and production processes at every level, just-in-time.

- Every employee can suggest an idea for process improvement
- Without judgment

In life: Comfortable, small steps towards development. _The method of small steps_

> "Even the longest journey begins with one step."
> —Lao TzuWhy Kaizen?

Changes from day to day are small and achievable almost effortlessly (favorable environment). In the long run, they lead
to a huge change.

Small Kaizen steps:

- turn off/deceive the mechanism of fear (fight/flight) before major changes
- mechanism of fear: midbrain -> amygdala; fight or flight reaction, triggered when we suddenly implement a change
  (innovation).
- Sudden change always causes fear
- Brain reaction is automatic
- more conscious part of the brain (cerebral cortex) can be _blocked_
- stimulate rational thinking and creative thinking
- create new neural connections while building new habits
- satisfy the need to _move forward_ and reduce stress
- effort is almost imperceptible
- especially when the task is enjoyable and causes pride

## Expect Fear

Fear warns of a challenge, signifies ambition, and strengthens hope. The more fear we feel, the more we care about
something.

By expecting fear, you can approach the problem calmly.

### Small Questions

The brain loves questions. Questions like "how can I lose 25kg in 2 weeks" are difficult and cause immense anxiety.
Asking **"what are the smallest steps I can take to improve my health?"** does not cause this anxiety:

- what can I do for 5 minutes a day to improve my budget/health/relationships?

Over time, the brain will start to respond with effective ideas - the amygdala rests, and the cortical brain can shine.

They require calm and patience. You should ask yourself questions regularly, as long as it is necessary for the brain to respond.

- we lose control over the process of change and cannot determine the moment when we have achieved the goal, just as we cannot say **when** we mastered driving a car or playing the guitar.

You should ask about positives (instead of asking _why am I so fat?_ ask _what little thing do I like about myself today?_).

Small questions may seem funny, but at least they do not evoke a negative reaction, fear.

The sign that you can move on is when you perform the previous step automatically, effortlessly, and even with pleasure.

### Examples

- Perry Spencer - microwave
- left a candy bar next to the radar
- asked "why did the radar melt the candy bar"
- asked more small questions
- microwave
- who can I ask for help?
- how can I improve my diet in the smallest way possible?
- what can I do to slightly improve my relationship with the client?
- what is one thing my husband does that makes me happy?
- what can I do to slightly move closer to my goal?
- who have I not talked to in a long time?
- what good thing can I say about _that_ person?

It is worth writing down the answers in a journal (or in another form).

### Mind Sculpting

It involves _pretending to perform actions_ in imagination. Useful in accomplishing difficult tasks.

The brain does not distinguish between reality and the world of imagination. By _training_ (imagining the exercise), I
still affect the chemistry of the body. Neuronal connections are still being formed.

1. Choose a task (that causes fear or discomfort)
2. Decide how long you want to _sculpt_ your mind each day (in seconds).

- the time must be chosen so that it is not difficult to perform the task **daily**

3. Perform the exercise in a quiet and comfortable place.
4. Imagine a difficult situation, a challenge.

- \_What do you see? What surrounds you? Who is there? What do they look like?\_\_ Try to see the facial expressions of
  other people, their clothes, posture.
- Also imagine smells, tastes, sounds.

5. Imagine performing the task

- words used, tone of voice, feeling of holding an object, etc.

6. Imagine a positive _outcome_ in response to completing the task

- public speaking -> eyes of the audience staring with curiosity, the sound of taking notes, etc.

7. Perform the task when you feel mentally prepared after the training.New Year's resolutions - examples

- Healthy eating
- _throw away_ the first bite of a fattening snack for a month
- _throw away_ the first two bites in the following month
- in the third month - three bites
- focus on eating slower and being more mindful while eating
- Exercise
- use a hand gripper while watching TV
- do one push-up a day for a period of time
- take the stairs instead of using the elevator for one floor
- ask yourself _what small activity would bring me pleasure_ (running, biking, or swimming)
- Saving money
- save 5 PLN a day
- for example, by replacing a larger coffee with a smaller one
- come up with one way to spend the saved money each day
- you will find more motivation to save instead of indulging in small pleasures
- Productivity
- write down things that consume your time
- write down things that you think are more productive. Add one thing to the list every day
- when you feel like it, try one of them in the style of kaizen

### Problem solving

Solve problems as soon as they arise.

- without procrastinating too much
- We are used to small problems, so we do not solve minor inconveniences.
- According to _the theory of broken windows_
- Yet they can be _warning signs_.
- Think about whether there were any small warning signs before the last, _big_ problem.
- Think about what helped solve that problem.

Ask yourself [[#Small Questions]] to learn how to solve problems in advance.

- _What step can I take to improve the situation?_
- _Do small problems tend to develop?_
- _Can I put the problem in a broader context?_

Never assume that _systems_ will work reliably (if something can go wrong, it will; _Murphy's Law_).

Do not react with anger. Responding with anger to life's challenges increases your chances of heart disease sevenfold
compared to people leading an identical lifestyle but with a different temperament.

Use your inner wisdom. Respond to the small, nagging feeling that _something is wrong_.

## Rewards

Reward yourself for each step.

Use **small rewards**. They are optimal because they use one of the principles of human nature: the larger the external reward, the
greater the chance that it will weaken or suppress the innate drive for excellence.

- Larger rewards reduce internal motivation in favor of external motivation.
- In a corporate environment, large monetary rewards may suggest that the employee is a cog in the machine and must be
  encouraged to act solely on promises of personal gain.
- Small rewards are a form of recognition and appreciation for the need for personal development and contribution.

### Examples

- Thank you
- Honest feedback about yourself (e.g. when the problem is dealing with criticism)
- Small and trivial \_gifts\_

### Small Moments

_Kaizen_ requires a slower pace. Recognizing small moments (appreciating the everyday wonders) teaches us to live in the
present moment.

Many breakthroughs have resulted directly from patient, daily observation of small phenomena.

### in relationships

In happy marriages, positive attitudes towards one's partner occur five times more often than negative ones. Small
gestures are appreciated, such as:

- speaking calmly when receiving a call from one's partner
- instead of getting upset or having a quick conversation suggesting that the call interrupted important tasks
- asking about the details of the other person's day
- putting the phone down when one's partner enters the room
- coming home at the agreed-upon time
- or at least notifying of a planned delay.
- focusing on one's partner's strengths rather than weaknesses

Small moments allow the other person to feel cared for and nurtured. It allows them to feel loved for who they are, not
just for what they do.

## Summary

The beauty of kaizen and its challenge lies in the fact that it requires faith in the power of the body and mind. By
taking small steps, you set your internal compass on a new course and allow the mind to take care of the rest.

Instead of aggressively forcing yourself to think about change in a "military" way, let your mind make jumps at its own
pace.

Look at kaizen as a process that never ends, perceiving life in terms of opportunities for continuous development,
constantly raising the bar, and developing your own potential.

Because what could be more important in life than extracting possibilities from every passing moment?
