title: How do I read?
---

I read in both English and Polish (depending on the source material).

## eBooks

Because of sync and note taking features I read eBooks mostly. Usually I read in the Kindle app on the [[tools/hardware/ipad|iPad]] or the [[tools/hardware/iphone|iPhone]]

### Bionic Reading
I convert every book to read with [Bionic Reading](https://bionic-reading.com/). It helps me to focus on the content.

### Note taking

I [[tools/apps/kindle|highlight]] a lot. I use these highlights to make [[reading/index|book notes]] shortly after finishing a book.

I have lots of unfinished books on my plate. When I want to get back to one, I create the book notes from the highlights I already made to remember what the book was about and continue reading from where I finished.

To make book notes I export the highlights to HTML file and process them one by one in code editor (I've created my own converter from Kindle's HTML format to JSON).

## Audiobooks

Usually I read audiobooks when I am _driving_ my daughters stroller outside. Occasionally in my car, but these days I don't drive alone this much.

### Note taking

It's impossible for audiobooks (thanks for nothing, Sherlock ðŸ¤“). The Audible app allows to make some bookmarks, but I am not going over these to listen particular sentences again.

In case of audiobooks, I usually google 3-5 summaries, and make my own book notes basing on these. On rare occasions I also take voice notes with thoughts of mine.

## Why bother with note taking?

It helps me to remember the key takeaways of the book at hand. I use them as the reference as well.
