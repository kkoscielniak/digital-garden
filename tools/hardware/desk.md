I use a semi-DIY, sit-stand desk composed of:

- a custom made, matte-black, 180x80cm desktop with additional display shelf
  - A friend of mine is a woodworker and I asked him to cut me one
  - I've attached the display shelf to the desktop with [these cheap _legs_](https://www.castorama.pl/noga-okragla-fikszo-30-x-100-mm-czarny/5908305612629_CAPL.prd) - it works surprisingly well
- [Spacetronik SPE-214W Mechanised Desk Stand](https://shop.spacetronik.eu/elektryczny-stelaz-biurkowy-spacetronik-spe-214w)
  - It has the handy height memory my kid loves to tinker with

## Chair

Currently I sit on [Ikea Jarvfjallet chair](https://www.ikea.com/pl/pl/p/jaervfjaellet-krzeslo-biurowe-z-podlokietnikami-glose-czarny-80510639/) I bought out of one of the companies I worked for, but I intend to change it to some Herman Miller in the future.
