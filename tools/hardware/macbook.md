title: 'MacBook Pro 14"'

Nowadays I use MacBook Pro 14" (2023) as my only computer.

## Specs

- M2 Pro (12 CPU cores, 19 GPU, 16 NE)
- 32 GB RAM
- 1 TB SSD
- **ANSI keyboard**
  - I'm more used to the ANSI layout since I started to use [[tools/hardware/keychron|Keychron K2]]

## Desktop mode

Most of the time I use it as a desktop computer with lid being closed. I connect this Mac to an external display (that also serves as the USB-C hub) and go through the day.

I don't use the internal MacBook screen in this setup, as I consider having more than one screen counter-productive - believe me, I tried. Probably I can blame [[knowledge/adhd|my very own neurodivergence]] for that.

To remediate the lack of screens, I maintain the [[tools/cli/yabai|structured virtual desktops]] on macOS (a.k.a. Mission Control). Each virtual desktop serves as _a canvas_ for a particular activity.
