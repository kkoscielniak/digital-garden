title: Philips 346B

I use Philips 346B1C, the 34" Ultra-wide display whenever I work at my [[tools/hardware/desk|desk]].

It has integrated power supply allowing me to connect my [[tools/hardware/macbook|MacBook]] with one cable to both charge it and use an external display ðŸ’ª

It also has a passive USB-C hub built in, although I've had to add an active one for my music-making endeavours.

While it's supposed to work in 100Hz, for some reason this does not work with my Mac at the highest resolution ðŸ¤”

I've tried to fix that with [SwitchRes X](https://www.madrau.com/) and it worked, but since I am not sure it wouldn't break anything, I removed this app after the trial ended. Now I'm capped at 60Hz. I don't care.
