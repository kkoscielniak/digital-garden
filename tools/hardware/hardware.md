# Hardware I use

I live in the Apple's ecosystem since 2014. While I am not a definite fanboy of theirs, I consider their devices as the best option for what I do for a living. Both Apple's hardware and software allow me to work the way I want to work - seamlessly, without having to think too much about them.

## Desk

- Custom made, 180x80cm desktop with additional display shelf
- [Spacetronik SPE-214W Mechanised Desk Stand](https://shop.spacetronik.eu/elektryczny-stelaz-biurkowy-spacetronik-spe-214w)
- [Ikea Jarvfjallet Chair](https://www.ikea.com/pl/pl/p/jaervfjaellet-krzeslo-biurowe-z-podlokietnikami-glose-czarny-80510639/)

## Workstation

- MacBook Pro 14" (2023) M2 Pro/32GB RAM/1 TB SSD/ANSI keyboard
  - Most of the time I use it as a desktop computer with a closed lid
  - I had to buy it directly from Apple, as the retailers didn't sell the ANSI ones at the time
- Philips 346B1C - 34" UltraWide display
  - It has integrated power supply allowing me to connect my Mac with one cable to both charge it and use an external display ðŸ’ª
  - It also has a USB HUB built in, although I've had to add additional one for all my peripherals
  - While it's supposed to work in 100Hz, for some reason this does not work most of the time with my Mac ðŸ¤” I am capped at 60Hz
- [[tools/hardware/keychron|Keychron K2 (v2)]]
- Logitech MX Master 2S
- Elgato Stream Deck 2
- Logitech C920 Webcam
- beierdynamic DT 770 Pro wired headphones
  - the sound quality is extraordinary
  - they don't support ANC (obviously), but I can live with that

  - I use [8bit Wireless USB Adapter](https://www.8bitdo.com/wireless-usb-adapter/) to connect PS5 DualSense controller to NS. It's awesome, try it
- Steam Deck 64GB + 256GB SD MMC
  - mostly for retro-gaming

## Others

  - I take my _credentials game_ seriously. You should too.
  - I have 2 of them, one is with me everywhere, the other is kept securely as a backup
