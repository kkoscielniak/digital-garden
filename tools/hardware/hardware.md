# Hardware I use

::: info
Note on Apple:
I live in the Apple's ecosystem since 2014. While I am not a definite fanboy of theirs, I consider their devices as the best option for what I do for a living. Both Apple's hardware and software allow me to work the way I want to work - seamlessly, without having to think too much about them.
