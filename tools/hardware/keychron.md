title: Keychron K2
---

My first attempt at [mechanical keyboards](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard).

I bought one after I swamped Apple Magic Keyboard in Yerba Mate during an interview to [Pickatale](https://pickatale.com) ðŸ˜…

I use White Backlight version with Gateron Brown switches. I also got a [palm rest](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-keyboard-wooden-palm-rest) of theirs.

## Pros

- It's mechanical
  - I never thought it's that much of joy to use mechanical keyboards
- Its layout is very similar to the MacBook keyboard
- It has backlight
- Has additional buttons that can be remapped (like the `PrnSc` and `Del` I don't use)

## Cons

- It does not have `Right Option` button
  - This can be fixed

### `Right Option` workaround

I've changed `Right Cmd` keycap to `Right Alt` (there are Windows counterparts in the box).

Also, since macOS Monterey it is available to remap the keybindings. I've created a [script](https://github.com/kkoscielniak/d3/blob/master/scripts/keymappings.sh) that remaps `Right Option` to `Right Cmd` and vice-versa.
