title: iPad Mini 6
---

I use an iPad Mini 6 with Apple Pencil 2 almost exclusively for reading.

## Apps

I try to keep the list of installed apps intact, to not lose the purpose of having this device. The list is limited to:

- [[tools/apps/kindle|Kindle]]
- Goodnotes
- Reeder
- utilities like Password Manager and 2FA tools

## Others

I use a 3rd party paper-like screen protector from [Nillkin](https://nillkin.org/tablet-accessories/apple-tablets-accessories/apple-ipad-mini-6-accessories/nillkin-apple-ipad-mini-6-2021-ag). 
It is cheaper than the original Paperlike, yet it seems to be of better quality (I've used OG Paperlike on my previous iPad).
