# Devices mortuary ðŸª¦

I keep track of the devices I've been using since I was 4yo.

::: info
This list contains only devices I **owned**. I've had a privilege to use mamy more, e.g. when I was working at a software house.

## Computers

- Commodore 64 <3
  - I wrote my first lines of code when I was 4 or 5yo on this machine

```
10 PRINT "HELLO WORLD!"
20 GOTO 10
RUN
```

- several Windows-based PCs
  - The first one ran under Windows older than most of my colleagues
- Acer Aspire 5730Z
  - My first notebook, thanks mama!
- Dell Latitude E6300
