title: iPhone 13 Pro Max
---

I am [[tools/hardware/mortuary|using iPhones]] since I got my first iPhone 5C in 2014. Currently my daily driver is the iPhone 13 Pro Max.

## Apps

I have a shitload of them on my phone, and I need to remove some üôà But they key ones for me are:

- banking and budgeting apps
- communicators (without notifications)
- utilities

## Grayscale display

I use my iPhone in grayscale mode most of the time.

> So you've bought a phone that has an amazing, 120Hz, hi-res display and I made it black and white?

Yes. Bear with me:

- I've noticed I use my phone **way less** since I've disabled colors. I don't get this _itch_ to check Instagram.
- My little kid wants to grab my phone less as well. _Less colors, less fun_ I suppose ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I use [[tools/automation/shortcuts/automated-grayscale|Personal Automation]] to automate enabling/disabling grayscale mode.
