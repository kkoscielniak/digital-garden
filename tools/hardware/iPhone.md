title: iPhone 13 Pro Max
---

I am using iPhones since I got my first iPhone 5C in 2014 with a short break for Samsung Galaxy Note 4. Currently my daily driver is the iPhone 13 Pro Max. 

## Apps

I have a shitload of them on my phone, and I need to remove some 🙈 But they key ones for me are:

- banking and budgeting apps
- communicators (without notifications)

## Monochrome screen

> So you've bought a phone that has an amazing, 120Hz, hi-res display and I made it black and white?

Yep, bear with me: 

- I've noticed I use my phone **way less** since I've disabled colors. I don't get this _itch_ to check  Instagram.
- My little kid wants to grab my phone less as well. _Less colors, less fun_ I suppose 🤷‍♂️

### Automated monochrome screen

> [!tip] This feature requires iOS 16 AFAIR

There are situations in which I want the screen to be colorful, like using the camera app, or watching YouTube.

For the _occasional_ situations like that, I've set the Side Button to toggle between colorful and B&W by pressing it 3 times.

For particular apps, like aforementioned camera, I've set an automation that disables B&W when I open it and enables, when I close it. It also resets my phone to B&W each day in the morning.
