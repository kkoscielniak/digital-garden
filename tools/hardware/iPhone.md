title: iPhone 13 Pro Max
---

I am using iPhones since I got my first iPhone 5C in 2014 with a short break for Samsung Galaxy Note 4. Currently my daily driver is the iPhone 13 Pro Max.

## Apps

I have a shitload of them on my phone, and I need to remove some üôà But they key ones for me are:

- banking and budgeting apps
- communicators (without notifications)

## Monochrome screen

> So you've bought a phone that has an amazing, 120Hz, hi-res display and I made it black and white?

Yep, bear with me:

- I've noticed I use my phone **way less** since I've disabled colors. I don't get this _itch_ to check Instagram.
- My little kid wants to grab my phone less as well. _Less colors, less fun_ I suppose ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Automated monochrome screen

::: warning
This feature requires iOS 16

There are rare occasions in which I want the screen to be colorful, like using the camera app, or watching YouTube. For such situations, I've set the Side Button to toggle between colorful and B&W by pressing it 3 times.

For particular apps, like aforementioned camera, I've set a Personal Automation that disables B&W when I open the app and reverts back to B&W when I close it. I also have another one that resets to B&W each morning.
