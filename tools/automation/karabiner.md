[Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) is a tool I use to map `Caps Lock` to the so-called _Hyper Key_ (`◆`), the combination of `⇧ + ⌃ + ⌥ + ⌘`), enabling additional layer of hotkeys to assign, like:

- `◆ + ⏯︎` - Spotify Play/Pause
- `◆ + M` - Search Menu Items with [[tools/apps/raycast|Raycast]]
- `◆ + K` - List [[tools/automation/keyboard-maestro/keyboard-maestro|Keyboard Maestro]] macros
