title: Toggle pomodoro in Session
---

This [[tools/automation/shortcuts/shortcuts|Shortcut]] toggles between Focus and Break modes in [[tools/apps/session|Session]] app. I use it once I get interrupted at work.

I've set a separate button on my [[tools/hardware/stream-deck|Stream Deck]] to toggle between modes.

::: info
It needs [[tools/automation/keyboard-maestro/keyboard-maestro|Keyboard Maestro]] installed for setting `Session_running` global variable. Probably another way could be used, even the simple txt file would work.
