I maintain 2 separate Obsidian Vaults: 
- the [_public_](https://github.com/kkoscielniak/digital-garden) Vault for maintaining this [[about/digital-garden|digital-garden]]
- the _private_ Vault for work-related notetaking; this one isn't as organised as the public one

## Plugins
- [obsidian-dangling-links](https://github.com/graydon/obsidian-dangling-links) - helps to fix `[[wikilinks]]` that point to non-existing notes
