This [[about/digital-garden|digital garden]] is built using [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev).

## Plugins
My gardening setup is basically pure VitePress with several plugins like: 
- `markdown-it-checkbox`
- `markdown-it-wikilinks`
- `vitepress-sidebar`

## Tweaks
- Use 
- [Extend default theme to display `$frontmatter.title` as H1 on every page](https://github.com/kkoscielniak/digital-garden/commit/ae956ba7eb2883a2e09056304290395a9d004128)
