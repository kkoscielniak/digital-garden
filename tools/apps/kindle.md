I read mostly in Kindle app on the [[tools/hardware/ipad|iPad]] or the [[tools/hardware/iphone|iPhone]] (this concerns bought both on and off Amazon). 

Thanks to Amazon's _ecosystem_ I can keep the books and the highlights in sync, export them (rather) easily and process whenever the need arises.

## Highlighting

I highlight **a lot**. I use different colors for different _types_ of highlights (ideas, links, quotes, useless but funny etc.).

I prefer to read on an [[tools/hardware/ipad|iPad]] due to it's Apple Pencil support - it's way more precise than using finger on eInk.

If I want to add something from myself to the book notes, I use iPad's [Scribble](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/ipad355ab2a7/ipados) feature.
