title: "zsh"
---

I use `zsh` on a daily basis. I don't use [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) since the experience has been pretty slow for me.

I prefer to install plugins using [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug) when possible, but I'm generally ok with sourcing the plugins in a direct way in my [`zshrc`](https://github.com/kkoscielniak/d3/blob/master/.zshrc).

I try to keep aliases and config files for different extensions in separate, sourced files.

My favorite extensions for `zsh` are:

- [starship prompt](https://starship.rs/)
- [[tools/cli/fzf|fzf]]
- [[tools/cli/z|z]]
