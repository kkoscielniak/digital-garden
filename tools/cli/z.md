title: "z"

[`z`](https://github.com/agkozak/zsh-z) is an extension for [[tools/cli/zsh|zsh]] that allows to quickly jump across the directories that I visit frequently or visited recently (something the creator calls _frecency_).

Thanks to that simple utility command I almost stopped using `cd` command.
