Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) consist of **_convolutional layers_** that scan **images** for local patterns (edges, textures) using **_filters_**.

These filters are small _windows_ that move across the image and respond to specific **patterns**.

After the convolutional layers, the information is passed on to further layers that perform **classification**.

CNNs are primarily known for image analysis, but they also have a place in the world of [[_inbox/GenAI]]. Their ability to recognize and manipulate spatial patterns gives them immense possibilities in the field of **image generation**.

CNNs _understand_ the structure of an image, recognize its various elements, and know how to connect them to create a new image.
