title: Temperature
---

_Temperature_ is a parameter that influences how tokens are chosen.

It is often referred to as the model's **_creativity_**. The **lower the temperature value**, the more probable tokens will be selected.

Low temperature can be useful for tasks requiring more precision.

Increasing the temperature may be useful for generating more creative texts.

::: warning
Low temperature doesn't guarantee full predictability, but simply reduces randomness. We still can't predict what will the model's response be.
