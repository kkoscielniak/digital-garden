title: Emergence

Emergence - a _phenomenon_ associated with behaviors appearing in [[_inbox/llm|llm]]s that were not present in the smaller-scale models.

These behaviors are likely due to the vast scale of data used for training the LLMs.

The _emergence_ phenomenon leads to the belief that the capabilities of today's LLMs are not yet fully known.

## Examples

- ability to translate from one language to another, even though the model wasn't precisely trained for this
  - it had contact with these languages though
