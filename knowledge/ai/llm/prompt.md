title: Prompt
---

Prompt is _an instruction_ that we give the [[_inbox/llm|LLM]]s.

Even though [[knowledge/ai/llm/gpt|GPT]] models are quite good at handling the unstructured instructions, there are several techniques that allow to directly influence the model behavior.

Prompts don't have to be grammatically correct. LLM usually will understand it probably. This can save [[knowledge/ai/llm/tokenization|tokens]].
