# Native Modules

Used to access native APIs of the Platform, reuse 3rd party libraries written directly for the platforms, or write high-performant, multi-threaded code (e.g. image processing).

The `NativeModule` system exposes instances native classes to JS as objects, allowing to execute native code from within JS.

> ðŸ’¡ React Native Team is working on [[TurboModules]] which are going to be the next big thing in the Native Modules world.
