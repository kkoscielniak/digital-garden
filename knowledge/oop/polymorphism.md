title: Polymorphism
---

Yet another Object-Oriented Programming core principle.

_Polymorphism_ ("many forms") allows us to create an object that may take many forms thanks to declaring `abstract` methods (the ones that don't have a body) in the `abstract` class.

Then, we will implement the `abstract` methods of the class in the classes that extend this class.
