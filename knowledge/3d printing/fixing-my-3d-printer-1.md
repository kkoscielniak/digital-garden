## Preface

In 2018, in a rush of emotion and hype, I bought second-hand [Tevo Tarantula 3D Printer](https://www.tevousa.com/products/tevo-tarantula-3d-printer-kit-with-2-free-rolls-of-filament). Since it was assembled already by the previous owner, I thought I'll just put it in my trunk, ride 60km and put it on my table, where - after plugging it - I could _make stuff_. Just like that. Boy, let me tell you, how wrong I was.

It got decallibrated, the straps went loose, the carriages went wobbly, the 3d-printed enhancements broke. Even the easiest of models were printed badly and I've spent a lot of time to fix that. Yet, even after evenings of tinkering, it was, like, 50% chance that the print will be bad. I didn't know what to do, so I invited my friend over. He helped me to fix that piece of metal and cables and for a while it was okay.

But then I moved to another place and the saga continued. Loose straps, wobbly carriages, more and more retractions, Krystian pissed off. I've tried to fix that once again, but I've spent lots of time, money and energy and ultimately accomplished nothing. I packed up all the parts and left the topic for 2 years.

I move out again, had a kid, and then I bought [Pocket C.H.I.P.](/knowledge/linux/pocket-chip/pocket-chip). It comes without casing and the keyboard is kinda shitty, so I looked up [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1998427/files) for something I could 3d-print. If only I had the printer working.

## Re-assembling the printer

For starters, I've decided to patiently disassemble every part just to reassemble it once again according to this assembly video:

I'm in the middle of assembling the frame, but I broke the hot-end, fan and heat sink already, so there's a lot to figure out.
