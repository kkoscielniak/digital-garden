[Chainlink](https://chain.link) is the most widely-known [Decentralized Oracle Network](/knowledge/web3/don.md).

To be precise, Chainlink is a framework for DONs, and is a way to get data in from multiple sources across multiple oracles. In this context, Chainlink is not a _data provider_. It's simply a decentralized network of centralized [oracle](/knowledge/web3/oracle.md) node operators.

The Chainlink network uses a system called [Off-Chain Reporting](https://docs.chain.link/docs/off-chain-reporting/) to reach a consensus on data off-chain, and report the data in a cryptographically proven single transaction back on-chain for users to digest.

Chainlink is entirely [blockchain](/knowledge/web3/blockchain.md) agnostic.
