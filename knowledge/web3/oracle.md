title: Oracle
---

An _oracle_ is any entity or device that connects a deterministic [blockchain](/knowledge/web3/blockchain.md) with [off-chain](/off-chain) data (and vice-versa).

Oracles are used to provide external data to the [smart-contracts](/knowledge/web3/smart-contracts.md). They serve as a middleware between the blockchain and the external APIs.

The oracles enter every data input through an external transaction.

The oracles solve [api-connectivity-problem](/knowledge/web3/api-connectivity-problem.md).

However, they are prone to the [single-point-of-failure](/knowledge/web3/single-point-of-failure.md) problem.

> _Oracles_ and _data providers_ are not the same thing. Confusingly, sometimes that is the case: a company that provides a data stream will themselves act as the oracle delivering that data to a user directly.
