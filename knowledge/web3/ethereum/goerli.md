title: Goerli Testnet
---

[GÃ¶rli Testnet](https://goerli.net/) is a testing [[knowledge/web3/ethereum/ethereum|ethereum]] netwrok run by Ethereum Foundation for testing the [smart-contracts](/knowledge/web3/smart-contracts.md) being developed for free.

Goerli uses fake GoerliETH (fake ETH) for [[knowledge/web3/transaction|transaction]]s.

## Faucets

To obtain GoerliETH it's necessary to _ask the network_ for some using _faucets_.

MetaMask has to be set to Goerli Test Network first (testing networks are not visible by default).

Faucets I've used before:

- [Goerli Proof-of-Work faucet](https://goerli-faucet.pk910.de/) (**recommended**) - requires some mining work in exchange for GoerliETH.
  - From my experience, it's the fastest way to obtain GoerliETH for development
- [Chainlink](https://faucets.chain.link/) - forces you to login with Twitter account
- [Goerli Faucet](https://goerlifaucet.com) - requires creating an [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) account and log in with it
- [Faucet Link](https://faucetlink.to/goerli) - other faucets for Goerli and Sepolia
