title: function
---

In [solidity](/knowledge/web3/solidity/solidity.md), function execution always needs to start with an external caller. A [smart-contract](/knowledge/web3/smart-contracts.md) will just sit on the blockchain doing nothing until someone calls one of its functions. So there will always be aÂ [msg.sender](/knowledge/web3/solidity/msg.sender.md).

- [address](/knowledge/web3/solidity/address.md)
- [require](/knowledge/web3/solidity/require.md)
- [assert](/knowledge/web3/solidity/assert.md)
