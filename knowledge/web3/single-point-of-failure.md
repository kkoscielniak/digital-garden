title: Single point of failure
---

The _single point of failure_ problem raises if the [smart-contracts](/knowledge/web3/smart-contracts.md) use centralized [oracle](/knowledge/web3/oracle.md).

A centralized oracle means that one entity has the power over your smart contract, and your smart contract is now no better than a regular contract.

The solution to this problem is to use [Decentralized Oracle Network](/knowledge/web3/don.md).
