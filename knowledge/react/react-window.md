[react-window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window) is a library used for optimising rendering of lists with many records with virtualisation of the list.

Virtualised lists may prevent **âŒ˜+F** to work properly, as the invisible elements are - in fact - removed from the [DOM](/knowledge/webdev/dom.md) tree.
