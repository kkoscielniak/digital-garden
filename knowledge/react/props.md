`props` are inputs to a React component.

They are single values or objects that are passed to [React](/knowledge/react/index.md) Components on creation. They are data passed (as single values or objects of values) down from a parent component to a child component.

They allow:

- passing custom data to the React component
- trigger the `state` changes
- to be rendered directly in the UI
