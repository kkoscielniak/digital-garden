title: Class vs Functional components
---

We have 2 types of components in [React](knowledge/react/react.md).

- [class-components](/knowledge/react/class-components.md)
- functional components

## Functional Components

- simpler to write comparing to class-based functions
- mainly focus on the UI of the application, not on the behavior
- these are basically `render()` from the class component
- can have state and mimic lifecycle events using [hooks](/knowledge/react/hooks.md)
