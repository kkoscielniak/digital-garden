title: Design Patterns
---

_Design Patterns_ are elegant solutions to repetitive problems in software design, like:

- the Undo mechanism ([[knowledge/design-patterns/behavioural/memento|memento]] pattern)

Design Patterns show how to structure classes, and how these classes should talk to each other.

Usually Design Patterns are split into three categories:

- creational patterns
  - they are about different ways to **create** objects
- structural patterns
  - about the **relationships between** these objects
- behavioural patterns
  - about the **communication/interaction between** these objects

There are many unofficial and undocumented patterns out there that we might find useful in certain situations.

One of the goals is to minimize [[knowledge/oop/coupling|coupling]].
