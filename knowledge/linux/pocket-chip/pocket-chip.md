title: Pocket C.H.I.P
---

I've bought the [Pocket C.H.I.P.](https://shop.pocketchip.co/collections/frontpage/products/pocket-c-h-i-p-new) device for learning purposes. And to have some fun.

Pocket C.H.I.P. is a portable, battery-powered Linux computer with a 480 x 272 touchscreen and something that resembles a QWERTY keyboard. It has the potential of Raspberry Pi, and it comes with a Debian-based OS along with a custom launcher and apps.

Thing is the C.H.I.P. is kinda obsolete (the company that made it, Next Thing Co., is now defunct), and it may be intimidating at first. I am slowly getting to know the device better, configuring it and figuring out what can I use it for. You may get something out of mine notes if you have/would like to have a device like this.
