title: Null Byte Injection
weight:
---

Using _Null Bytes_ is an injection technique where URL-encoded representation such as `%00` or `0x00` in hex with user-supplied data to _terminate_ strings (disregarding whatever comes after the Null Byte.

By adding the Null Byte at the end of the [payload](knowledge/off-sec/glossary/payload.md), we tell the `include` function to ignore anything after Null Byte which may look like:

```
include("languages/../../../../../etc/passwd%00").".php");
```

Effectively making the function call to be:

```
include("languages/../../../../../etc/passwd");
```

> [!tip] The `%00` trick has been fixed in PHP 5.3.4
