title: Incident Response
---

An _incident_ is a breach of security. Actions taken to resolve and remediate the threat are known as _Incident Response_.

Incidents are classified using a rating of urgency and impact. Urgency is determined by the type of attack faced. Impact is determined by the affected system and what impact that has on business operations.

## Phases

There are 6 phases of IR:

- Preparation
  - Do we have the resources and plans in place to deal with the security incident?
- Identification
  - Has the threat and the threat actor been correctly identified in order for us to respond to?
- Containment
  - Can the threat/security incident be contained to prevent other systems or users from being impacted?
- Eradication
  - Remove the active threat.
- Recovery
  - Perform a full review of the impacted systems to return to business as usual operations.
- Lessons Learned
  - What can be learnt from the incident?
