title: Red team
---

Red team members (or _red teamers_) share similarities to [[knowledge/off-sec/pentesting/pentesting|pentesters]], with a more targeted job role.

While the pentesters look to uncover many vulnerabilities across systems to keep cyber-defence in good standing, red teamers are enacted to test the company's detection and response capabilities.

Red teamers perform adversarial simulation to simulate malicious behavior and test the [[knowledge/off-sec/pentesting/red-vs-blue|blue team]]. This involves imitating cyber criminals' actions to:

- emulate malicious attacks
- uncover exploitable vulnerabilities
- retaining access
- avoiding detection.

Typically the red team assessments run for up to a month and are held by team external to the company. They are often best suited to organisations with mature security programs in place.

The ultimate goal is to:

- Assess organisations' security controls, threat intelligence, and [[knowledge/off-sec/pentesting/ir|ir]] procedures
- Evaluate and report on insights, with actionable data for companies to avoid real-world instances
