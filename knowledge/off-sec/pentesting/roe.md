_Rules of Engagement_ is a document that is created at the initial stages of a pentesting engagement. This document consists of three main sections, which are are ultimately responsible for deciding how the engagement is carried out.

> [!tip] It's not the same as [sow](knowledge/off-sec/pentesting/sow.md)

> This might be a bit tricky, but SOW is what you promise to do and ROE is what you promise **not** to do.

- Permission
  - gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out This permission is essential to legally protect individuals and organisations for the activities they carry out.
- Test Scope
  - annotates specific targets to which the engagement should apply (e.g. certain servers, or apps, but not the entire network)
- Rules
  - defines **exactly** the techniques that are permitted during the engagement, e.g. phishing attacks are prohibited, but MITM is okay
