title: LFI/RFI prevention
---

To prevent the file inclusion vulnerabilities ([lfi](knowledge/off-sec/pentesting/lfi.md) and [rfi](knowledge/off-sec/pentesting/rfi.md)) it's wise to:

- Keep system and services, including webapp frameworks, updated with the latest version
- Turn off PHP errors to avoid leaking the path of the application and other potentially revealing information
- Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Disable some PHP features that cause file inclusion vulnerabilities if your web app doesn't need them, eg `allow_url_fopen` and `allow_url_include`
- Carefully analyze the web application and allow only protocols and PHP wrappers that are in need
- Never trust user input and use **input validation** against file inclusion
- Implement _whitelisting_ for file names and locations as well as _blacklisting_
