title: Red vs Blue Teams
---

Both [red team](knowledge/off-sec/pentesting/red-team.md) and [[knowledge/off-sec/pentesting/red-vs-blue|blue team]] work **toward** improving an organization's security, but they do so differently:

- A red team plays the role of the attacker by trying to find vulnerabilities and break through cybersecurity defenses
- A blue team defends against attacks and responds to incidents when they occur. They also use the red team's findings to harden their networks

The [purple team](knowledge/off-sec/pentesting/purple-team.md) may exist within the organisation as well.
