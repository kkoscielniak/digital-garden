title: Burp Comparer
---

*Burp Comparer*Â allows us to compare two pieces of data at either word or byte level.

Even though it's not something that is unique to Burp Suite, being able to send pieces of data directly into a comparison tool with a single keyboard shortcut can speed things up considerably.

As with most Burp Suite modules, we can also load data into Comparer from other modules by _Right Click_ -> _Send to Comparer_.
