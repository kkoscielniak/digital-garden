`nmap` (Network Mapper) is an industry standard tool for mapping networks, identifying live hosts and discovering running services.

A Nmap scan usually goes through these steps, although many are optional and depend on the command-line arguments you provide:

1. [Enumerate targets](knowledge/off-sec/tools/nmap/enumerating-hosts.md)
2. [Discover live hosts](knowledge/off-sec/tools/nmap/discovering-live-hosts.md)
3. [Reverse-DNS lookup](knowledge/off-sec/tools/nmap/reverse-dns.md)
4. Ports scanning
   1. [ports-scanning-basic](knowledge/off-sec/tools/nmap/ports-scanning-basic.md)
   2. [ports-scanning-advanced](knowledge/off-sec/tools/nmap/ports-scanning-advanced.md)
   3. [spoofing-and-decoys](knowledge/off-sec/tools/nmap/spoofing-and-decoys.md)
5. Detect versions
6. Detect OS
7. Traceroute
8. [Scripts](knowledge/off-sec/tools/nmap/scripting-engine.md)
