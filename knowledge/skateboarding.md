Learning how to ride a skateboard is a childhood dream of mine, one that every now and then comes back and calls for attention.

I've been longboarding on stock [Miller Collection 38](https://www.longboardy.pl/product-pol-9034-Miller-Collection-38.html) when I was still a student, but in the meantime I moved to another city, the COVID-19 pandemic began, I got married and ultimately had a lovely toddler. There was no time for living the skate life. But I am slowly getting back on trucks.

This year I bought my very first skateboard, namely the [Element Tecuala 8"](https://www.elementbrand.co.uk/8%2522-tecuala-skateboard-W4CPB1ELP1.html) set, along with the wrist, knee and elbow protectors and I practice pushes now. One of my long-term goals is to land a proper kickflip.
