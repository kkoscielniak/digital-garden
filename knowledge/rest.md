title: REST
---

Stands for **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer. Web services that offer this architecture are known as RESTful services.

Requests are made to RESTful web services in a standardised way via [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier)s. An URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) identifies a resource in the server by name, without implying its location or how to access it.
