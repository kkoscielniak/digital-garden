title: Beatmaking
---

::: info
I collect vinyl records and learn to create music based on samples from them.

As of now I don't publish my creations because, to be honest, they are average. I still struggle with making a swingy drum patterns that won't sound _robotic_.

I treat this hobby more as a form of self-therapy, a way to process emotions and redirect focus on something other than these omnipresent screens.

I use MPC Live (1 gen.) for making beats. Most of the time in standalone mode.
