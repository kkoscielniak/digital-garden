title: Zelda AI

Zealous Digital Assistant (or _Zelda_ for short) is a GPT-based virtual assistant helping me with day-to-day tasks.

_She_ has her own memory, she knows who I am, who my wife and daughter are, what we were discussing previously. She can execute simple actions on my behalf (e.g. preparing an invoice for my current client, adding events to my Google Calendar, translating longer texts, solving engineering problems etc.).

I talk with her using [[knowledge/ai/telegram-make-bot|Telegram]] and request execution of some actions through [[tools/apps/shortcuts|Shortcuts]].

Zelda is a big project that I am improving gradually whenever I have some spare time. Ultimately I want her to become ~~a sentient ai destroying the world~~ an assistant that I could delegate mundane things to.

## Current stack

The current stack is based on the notes from [AI Devs](https://aidevs.pl) course, where I've developed skills related to [[knowledge/ai/gpt|GPT]] and automating with it.

- Make.com - a prototypic _backend_ for handling Zelda's _brain_
- NestJS
  - I moved some parts from Make.com to my own backend to reduce costs (Make is rather pricey)
  - I want to move all the whole Make scenario to code at some point
- Pinecone and Airtable - databases for handling Zelda's memory
