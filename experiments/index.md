title: Experiments

I have a constant stream of pet-project [[experiments/ideas|ideas]], but no time/motivation to make them happen. On rare occasions I set some time blocks aside to see how an idea can be executed.

I usually take a _Scratch Your Own Itch_ approach - I'm building things for myself to use and learn from. Once I see that the project could also help others, I start to showcase some bits around [Instagram Stories](https://instagram.com/pankoscielniak).

I didn't release anything big to the public yet. Most of the time I get bored and move on, but there are some that **I want to happen** and these can be found in this [garden](/about/digital-garden.md).
