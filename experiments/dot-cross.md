A _Bullet Journal_ app with Notion-like experience. Blazing fast UI. No fuss. Google Calendar Integration. External API. Mobile app (at some point).

## Why?

I've been using the paper-based Bullet Journal for around 2 years now and I want to have one in _the cloud_.

There are some apps that try to be the BuJo in the cloud, but I consider them unusable. Their UX is over-bloated. Adding a task, for example, needs too many _clicks_ for my taste.

On the other hand, the apps like Notion or Obsidian don't work for me, as they have too many features that make it hard for me to use them rapidly. _Shall this be a database? How shall I render that? Should I create new page for this project? Or put it into a table?_ etc.

## Status

In early stage of development, nothing more to share yet.
