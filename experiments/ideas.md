# Ideas worth exploring

Here I keep list of ideas I came with, but haven't had time to [[experiments/experiments|experiment]] with them yet.

::: warning
Some of these might not be as useful as one might think, but executing them might be a funny thing to do.
:::

## [GFDA](https://gfda.co/)-like wallpapers creator

- webapp that allows to create text-based wallpaper with the content of your own
- Things that could be useful for making such app
  - [RenderForm](https://renderform.io) for creating the image
  - `imagemagick`
- could have API for automation
  - possible Make integration:
    - Get inspirational quote from _somewhere_
    - Make a wallpaper
    - Save it to DropBox
    - Automate setting a wallpaper on macOS with the saved file
    - Profit

## AI-based Arc Browser _space manager_

- Lists all the spaces and all the tabs open in the [[tools/apps/arc|Arc]] browser
- Asks GPT to categorise (normalised) tab titles into spaces
- The categorisation based on space name/domain
- Moves tabs to particular spaces according to GPTs response
- This could be done using bunch of AppleScripts, as Arc provides a dictionary
- I could use [[tools/apps/raycast|Raycast]] extension to fire the categorisation

## _ViteBlish_

- An enhanced theme for [[tools/apps/vite-press|VitePress]] that would provide additional features like:
  - backlinks
  - knowledge graph
    - https://github.com/penrose/penrose/ - diagrams maker
  - deep integration with [[tools/apps/obsidian|Obsidian]]
- Think Obsidian Publish/[Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) but made for VitePress
- Progress on that could be seen in this [[about/digital-garden|digital garden]] since I experiment with many features in my setup
- Perhaps it could be a set of VitePress plugins instead of the fully-featured theme?

## Others

- Ron Swanson's daily quote Slack Integration
- Set of Make integrations helping [[knowledge/adhd|neurodivergent]] people
