title: Experiments
---

I love to experiment with new [[experiments/ideas|ideas]] for apps. Usually I take a _Scratch Your Own Itch_ approach - I am highly motivated when building stuff that ultimately would make my life easier. I set some time blocks aside of my daily job and family obligations and let the creativity flow.

I don't call these things the _pet-projects_. Pet-projects are, by their nature, prone to failure. And the _failure_ hurts.

On the other hand, the _experiments_, by definition, can't fail:

Approaching the execution of an idea as the _experiment_ makes me open for the said experiment to result in:

- making a discovery
  - Every idea I've experimented on provided many discoveries and learnings, ultimately improving my craft
- test a hypothesis
  - Before delving in, I can't say for sure I know if the idea is valid
  - If the idea proves hard to be executed in the way I've _hypothesized_ it will, it's still a bummer, but I move on rather easily

While this approach is rather subjective and my experimentation methods are far from scientific, it is still an exciting way of trying to execute.

I didn't release anything to the public yet. Mostly because I got bored. Rarely the execution is harder than I've initially assumed. There are, however, apps **I want to happen eventually** and these can be found in this [[about/digital-garden|garden]].
